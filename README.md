# World_Weather_Analysis

Purpose of the project is to launch an app which will help clients find their vacation destination within 2000 randomly generatted latitudes and longitudes. We will be making a list of cities with important weather elements like Humidity, Maximum Temperature, Wind Speed, Cloudiness and current weather description. Cliens will be able to filter out cities based on their preferred temperature, find hotels within those cities and make travel itinerary for their future travel plans.
